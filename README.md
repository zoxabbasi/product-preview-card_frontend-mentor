## My process

- Used CSS grid and flex to style the page, alongue with variables and locally scoped variables and many other CSS properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS GRID
- CSS FLEXBOX
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I have learned the most, is the use of picture element and how source tag works with it.

### Continued development

I should work more with CSS grid to get a better understanding of it.

### Useful resources
